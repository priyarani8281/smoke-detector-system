# 🔥 Smoke Detector System  
**Hackathon Project | Team: Tri Nova**

A compact and reliable **Smoke Detector System** designed to detect hazardous gas/smoke levels and alert users in real time using visual and audio indicators. This project focuses on **safety, simplicity, and practical deployment** for homes, labs, and small workplaces.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The system continuously monitors air quality using a gas sensor. When smoke or gas concentration exceeds a safe threshold, it:
- Triggers a **buzzer alarm**
- Activates **LED indicators**
- Displays alert messages on a **16×2 LCD**

Built using **Arduino UNO**, the project demonstrates effective use of embedded systems for real-world safety applications.
